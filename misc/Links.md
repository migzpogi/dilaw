[String Quotes](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#string-quotes)  

In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. This PEP does not make a recommendation for 
this. Pick a rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one 
to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability.  

[PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)  

Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a one-line docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a 
more elaborate description.
